## Node.js

-   **Maturity:** Most mature and widely used. Huge npm ecosystem.
-   **Performance:** Solid, but not as fast as Bun in benchmarks.
-   **TypeScript:** Requires transpilation (ts-node, Babel, etc.), but recent versions (v23+) are improving TypeScript support.
-   **Security:** No permissions system by default.
-   **Tooling:** Relies on external tools (Jest, Webpack, etc.).
-   **Use Cases:** Production servers, CLI tools, legacy and enterprise apps.

## Deno

-   **Maturity:** Created by Node.js co-founder Ryan Dahl to address Node's shortcomings.
-   **Performance:** Faster startup and cold start times than Node.js; slightly slower than Bun in some benchmarks.
-   **TypeScript:** First-class, native support.
-   **Security:** Secure by default (explicit permissions for file, network, etc.).
-   **Tooling:** Built-in test runner, formatter, linter, bundler.
-   **Compatibility:** Supports npm modules, but some Node.js APIs may not be fully compatible.
-   **Use Cases:** Modern web servers, secure scripting, edge computing.

## Bun

-   **Maturity:** Youngest, but rapidly evolving. Designed as an all-in-one toolkit.
-   **Performance:** Fastest runtime in most benchmarks (e.g., HTTP server, cold starts, bundling, package installs).
-   **TypeScript:** Native support, very fast transpilation.
-   **Security:** No permissions system by default.
-   **Tooling:** Includes test runner, bundler, transpiler, package manager (bun install).
-   **Compatibility:** Aims for full Node.js compatibility, runs most npm packages, supports frameworks like Next.js and Express.
-   **Use Cases:** High-performance web servers, full-stack apps, rapid prototyping.

## Performance Benchmarks (2025)

-   **HTTP Server:** Bun consistently outperforms Node.js and Deno in raw HTTP benchmarks.
-   **Cold Start (Serverless):** Deno has the fastest cold start times in VM environments, followed by Bun, then Node.js.
-   **Package Installation:** Bun's `bun install` is significantly faster than npm, pnpm, or yarn.

## Roadmap & Future Directions

-   **Node.js:** Focus on improved TypeScript support, performance, and security updates. Still the default for enterprise and legacy systems.
-   **Deno:** Expanding npm compatibility, improving cloud and edge deployment, and enhancing security features.
-   **Bun:** Aims to be a drop-in replacement for Node.js with a focus on speed, all-in-one tooling, and full compatibility with npm ecosystem.

## Conclusion

-   **Node.js** is the most stable and widely adopted, with the largest ecosystem. Best for enterprise and legacy projects.
-   **Deno** is ideal for secure, modern development with built-in tooling and native TypeScript support.
-   **Bun** is the fastest and most integrated, great for performance-critical apps and developers wanting an all-in-one toolkit.

All three runtimes are actively developed and have unique strengths. The best choice depends on your project's needs: stability and ecosystem (Node.js), security and modern features (Deno), or speed and integrated tooling (Bun).
